<p><img src="/download.jfif" alt="Worse Album"></p>
<h1>Number 1</h1>
<ul>
<li>Lack of rythem
The rythem that pink tape had prodived has to be the biggest amount
of almagymy of time and pacing, it's worse than letting a 12 year old
on a midi device to make his song to make him &quot;money&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h1>Number 2</h1>
<ul>
<li>Insane amount of anime girls yelling
I don't know what the creative direction was here but it most definitely
hit the mark of giving my braincells cancer while making me go deaf.
I never had an experience more unsettling than listening to &quot;for legal
purposes i will not disclose which song is legitimate torture&quot; for the
first time. Afterwards i picked up my bible and prayed for god to smite
the hands that had made me regret breathing every 2 minutes.</li>
