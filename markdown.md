====================================

# Number 1
- Lack of rythem
The rythem that pink tape had prodived has to be the biggest amount
of almagymy of time and pacing, it's worse than letting a 12 year old 
on a midi device to make his song to make him "money"

# Number 2
- Insane amount of anime girls yelling
I don't know what the creative direction was here but it most definitely
hit the mark of giving my braincells cancer while making me go deaf. 
I never had an experience more unsettling than listening to "for legal
purposes i will not disclose which song is legitimate torture" for the
first time. Afterwards i picked up my bible and prayed for god to smite
the hands that had made me regret breathing every 2 minutes.

# Number 3
